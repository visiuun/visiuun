    </section>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>1. Preamble and Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Archrose, a Roblox game experience and associated Discord server (collectively, the "Services") created and operated by Visiuun and Aleksandr (hereinafter referred to as "Developers," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms"), constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "player") and the Developers regarding your access to and use of Archrose, including the Roblox game, the Archrose Discord server, and all related services, features, content, and functionalities (collectively, the "Services").</p>
        <p>By accessing, playing, participating in, or otherwise using any part of the Services, including the Archrose Roblox game and/or the Archrose Discord server, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have carefully read, fully understand, and unequivocally agree to be bound by all provisions of these Terms. This agreement governs your relationship with us in relation to the Services. If you do not agree to each and every term and condition set forth herein, you are expressly prohibited from accessing or using the Services and must immediately cease all gameplay, Discord server participation, and related activities.</p>
        <p>Your acceptance of these Terms is a condition precedent to your right to use the Services, including playing Archrose and participating in the Archrose Discord server. Continued use of the Services shall be deemed as ongoing and reaffirming consent to these Terms, including any modifications or amendments made in accordance with Section 11.</p>

        <h2>2. Age Restriction, Content Warning, and Parental Responsibility</h2>
        <p><b>THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BOTH THE ARCHROSE ROBLOX GAME AND THE ARCHROSE DISCORD SERVER, ARE DESIGNED AND INTENDED FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY. BOTH THE GAME AND THE DISCORD SERVER MAY CONTAIN EXPLICIT THEMES OF MACROPHILIA (SIZE DIFFERENCE) AND OTHER FETISH-RELATED CONTENT, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED OFFENSIVE, DISTURBING, OR INAPPROPRIATE BY SOME INDIVIDUALS.</b> This content may be present in game elements, user-generated content within the game, and user-shared content and discussions on the Discord server.</p>
        <p><b>MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENT:</b> You must be at least 16 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, to access and use the Services, including both the Archrose Roblox game and the Archrose Discord server. By proceeding to use the Services, you affirmatively warrant and represent that you meet or exceed this minimum age requirement. If you are under the age of 16, or the applicable age of majority, you are strictly prohibited from using the Services, and any such access is unauthorized and in violation of these Terms.</p>
        <p><b>PARENTAL/GUARDIAN RESPONSIBILITY:</b> We strongly advise parents and legal guardians to exercise due diligence in monitoring their children's online activities, including their participation in online game communities and Discord servers. If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child has accessed the Services without your consent and in violation of these age restrictions, please contact us immediately. While we implement age gating through these Terms, we cannot guarantee prevention of access by underage users and are not responsible for unauthorized access. Parental supervision and control are paramount.</p>
        <p><b>CONTENT WARNING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:</b> You acknowledge and understand the mature themes of macrophilia and potentially other fetish-related content present within the Services, including both the Archrose Roblox game and the Archrose Discord server. You accept that you may encounter content, scenarios, user interactions, and user-shared art related to these themes. You agree that you are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of the Services' content for yourself and accept all risks associated with exposure to such themes.</p>

        </ol><br>

        <h4>Reporting Inappropriate Conduct and Developer/Moderator Intervention</h4>
        <p>If you encounter another user engaging in conduct that violates these Terms, Roblox's Community Rules (in-game), or Discord's Terms of Service/Community Guidelines (on Discord), within the Services, we encourage you to utilize the platform-specific reporting features as the primary and most effective method for addressing such behavior. Within the Roblox game, use Roblox's reporting tools. Within the Discord server, use Discord's reporting features and contact Discord server moderators or administrators, if available. For issues directly related to the Services themselves, technical malfunctions across platforms, or specific concerns regarding these Terms that platform-specific reporting cannot address, you may also contact us directly at <a href="mailto:report-abuse@visiuun.com">report-abuse@visiuun.com</a>.  Please provide detailed information and evidence when submitting reports, specifying whether the issue occurred in the Roblox game or on the Discord server.</p>
        <p><b>While we encourage user reporting and may, at our sole and unfettered discretion, elect to investigate and take remedial action against egregious violations of these Terms or applicable laws within either the Roblox game or the Discord server, you expressly acknowledge and agree that the Developers are under no legal or contractual obligation to actively monitor user conduct across both platforms, intervene in every user dispute, resolve every reported issue to the user's subjective satisfaction, or provide any specific level of moderation or enforcement on either platform. Our capacity to intervene is inherently limited by the respective platform architectures of Roblox and Discord, available moderation tools on each platform, and our own finite resources.  Any moderation efforts undertaken by the Developers or designated moderators are provided strictly on a "best efforts" basis and without any representation, warranty, or guarantee, express or implied, that we will successfully prevent, detect, or fully rectify all instances of inappropriate user conduct across the Services.  You explicitly understand and accept that using the Services necessarily entails inherent risks associated with exposure to the potentially unpredictable behavior of other online users on both the game and the Discord server, and you voluntarily assume all such risks.  The Developers expressly disclaim any and all liability for user-generated content, communications, and the actions or inactions of individual users within the Services, including both the Roblox game and the Archrose Discord server, even if such content or conduct is deemed harmful, offensive, illegal, or in violation of these Terms. This disclaimer applies equally to user behavior within the game and on the Discord server.</b></p>

        <h2>4. Service Modifications, Updates, Availability, and Termination</h2>
        <p>The Developers reserve the absolute, unconditional, and unilateral right to, at any time and for any reason, without prior notice or any liability whatsoever to you or any third party, modify, update, patch, alter, change, suspend, restrict access to, or permanently discontinue the Services, or any aspect, feature, component, or functionality thereof, whether temporarily or permanently. This encompasses, without limitation, modifications to the Archrose Roblox game (as detailed in the previous version of these terms) and also includes the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Archrose Discord server, its channels, features, access, or overall operation.  This includes changes to server rules, moderation policies, channel structure, and server availability.</p>
        <p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Developers shall not be held liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary, arising out of or in connection with any such modification, update, suspension, restriction, or discontinuation of the Services, including the Discord server, even if such actions result in the loss of game progress, virtual items, in-game currency, Discord server access, server roles, user-generated content shared on Discord, or any other tangible or intangible losses, or negatively impact your experience with the Services in any manner.  We provide the Services, including the Discord server, on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis and do not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or continuous access to either the game or the Discord server. The Developers are not responsible for any game downtime, server outages (Roblox or Discord), technical malfunctions, data loss (game or Discord data), or any other technical issues that may occur across the Services, regardless of cause or duration.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Developers reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Services, in whole or in part, including access to both the Roblox game and the Discord server, immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including, but not limited to, your breach of these Terms, suspected illegal activity on either platform, prolonged inactivity in the game or on the Discord server, engaging in conduct that we, in our sole discretion, deem harmful to other users, the Developers, or third parties, technical issues, unforeseen service disruptions, or for any business reason at the Developers' sole discretion. Upon termination, your right to use the Services will cease immediately, and we shall have no obligation to provide refunds, compensation, or access to User Content, virtual items, Discord server roles, or content shared on the Discord server.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p>Archrose, including all Game Content (as defined previously for the Roblox game) and also extending to content related to Archrose on the Discord server, encompassing, without limitation, server design, channel structure, server logos, graphics used on the Discord server, bot configurations, announcements, and official communications by the Developers on the Discord server ("Discord Server Content"), are the exclusive property of Visiuun and Aleksandr, or our licensors, and are rigorously protected by applicable copyright laws, trademark laws, patent laws, trade secret laws, moral rights laws, communications regulations, statutes, and other intellectual property laws and international treaties, both within Canada and worldwide. All intellectual property rights in and to Archrose, the Game Content, and the Discord Server Content are expressly reserved and retained by the Developers and our licensors.</p>
        <p>Subject to your strict and ongoing compliance with all provisions of these Terms, the Developers grant you a limited, non-exclusive, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and terminable license to access and use the Services, including playing Archrose and participating in the Archrose Discord server, solely for your personal, private, non-commercial entertainment and community engagement purposes, strictly in accordance with the intended functionalities of the Services and these Terms. This limited license explicitly does not convey to you any ownership rights, title, or intellectual property rights in or to Archrose, the Game Content, or the Discord Server Content.  The prohibitions listed in the previous version of these terms regarding Game Content now also apply to Discord Server Content, mutatis mutandis, where applicable to the nature of Discord server content. Unauthorized use of Discord Server Content is also prohibited.</p>
        <p>All rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms are explicitly reserved by Visiuun and Aleksandr. Any unauthorized use of the Services, the Game Content, or the Discord Server Content constitutes a material breach of these Terms and may violate applicable intellectual property laws, platform terms of service, and community guidelines, subjecting you to potential civil and criminal penalties, as well as platform-specific sanctions (e.g., bans from Roblox or Discord).</p>

THIS EXTREMELY BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES, WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION WHATSOEVER, TO:</p>

        <h2>Terms of Service - For Dummies (Simple Version)</h2>
        <div class="stupid-people-content">
            <h3>Basically, you agree to these things by using Archrose:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You must be 16 or older.</strong> The game and Discord have adult themes, so it's not for kids.</li>
                <li><strong>Behave yourself.</strong> No being mean, cheating, doing illegal stuff, or breaking Roblox/Discord rules.</li>
                <li><strong>We're not responsible if things go wrong.</strong> The game and Discord are provided "as is". We're not liable for any issues, user behavior, or if you lose anything. You use it at your own risk.</li>
                <li><strong>We can change or stop the game/Discord anytime.</strong> We can update, change, or even shut down the game or Discord without asking you. No refunds or guarantees are given.</li>
                <li><strong>Everything in Archrose belongs to us.</strong> You can use the game and Discord for fun, but you don't own anything in it. Don't try to steal or copy our stuff.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In short: Behave, be old enough, and don't blame us if something happens. If you don't agree, don't use Archrose.</strong></p>
